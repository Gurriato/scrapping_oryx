# Russian invasion of Ukraine Dashboard
Still WIP but working

Why I built this scrapper? because others had a lot of inconsistencies. Even with errors this is most accurate Oryx scrapper you are going to find.
Why others are not as accurate? because Oryx blog is manually feed. Therefore, there are a lot of exceptions you had to code in order to capture all the data.

Commits are welcome

#### To Do
- Add dates to all entries. This information is not available in Oryx as is a blog post that is regulary updated, but some other people has capture some of this dates (see other related projects).
- Create Python module structure
- Clean code & Tests
- Create cron to update and to push to git
- Create code to look for differences on the daily update

## ToDo Project
- Dashboard (grafana? dash?)
- add lostarmor.info and bmpvsu.ru as datasources
- add platforms and system database
- addmap (see leedrake solution in R in other related projects)
- GIS add
